	help
	  Set the initialization priority number. Do not change it unless
	  you know what you are doing. It has to start before the net stack.

config IEEE802154_EFR32_RX_STACK_SIZE
	int "Driver's internal RX thread stack size"
	default 6400
	help
	  This option sets the driver's stack size for its internal RX thread.
	  The default value should be sufficient, but in case it proves to be
	  a too little one, this option makes it easy to play with the size.
